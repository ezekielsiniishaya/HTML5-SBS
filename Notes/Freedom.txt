	VERSE	

		Heavy chains round my neck all day long yeah 
		That is how I've been bound all my life yeah
		Many years don dey roll roll roll and nothing fit 				save me until grace came and set me free..
		All the people wey dey see me no de see me
		They get eyes but they're blind they can't see 
		Ain't no freedom in the dark, yeah I can tell, 
		cause all these while I've been held down in the 				grave

	VIBE

		Yeah I've been down
		My light is all out 
		ooooooooohooooooooo
		No Joy for me
		I am all alone
		oooooooohoooooooooo
