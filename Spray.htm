      For best results, you must apply some pesticides to your fruit trees. The
      goal, of course, is to get the best fruit with the least amount of
      chemicals. This guide provides some tips and tchniques for achieving this
      goal.

      Unfortunately, most people lack the proper equipment. Most hobbyists have
      either a handheld tank sprayer that required pumping, or a sprayer that
      fits on the end of a hose. The pump sprayer applies chemicals accurately,
      and enables the proper mixing to be done, but the range is limited and
      upper branches may be missed. Hose-end sprayers can reaach high up, but it
      is difficult to properly guage the mix due to fluctuations in water
      pressure. The mix of water to chemical is an essential factor, so we do
      not reccomend hose-end sprayer. Either use a tank sprayer (and stand on a
      ladder if needed), rent equipment, or hire professonals to do the
      spraying.
